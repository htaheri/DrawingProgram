Drawing Program
This is a simple text (ASCII) based drawing program (something similar to a simplified version of Paint). 
The program allows users to:
	Create a new canvas
	Draw on the canvas using text based commands
	Quit the program


Example Description
C w h Create a new canvas of width w and height h
L x1 y1 x2 y2 Draw a new line from coordinates (x1, y1) to (x2, y2) horizontally or vertically. Lines are made up of the x character
R x1 y1 x2 y2 Draw a new rectangle, with upper left corner at coordinate (x1, y1) and lower right coordinate at (x2, y2). Lines are made up of the x character
Q Quit the program

Comments:
Some classes still need implementing unit tests
